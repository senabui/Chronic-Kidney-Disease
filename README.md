# Predictive Analysis and Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease

## Within this project, the goal was to answer the following two questions: to what extent do diabetes, hypertension, and a family history of chronic kidney disease contribute to the likelihood of chronic kidney disease diagnosis, and how do their individual and combined effects impact predictive accuracy in a machine learning model? Can we develop a personalized risk scoring system for chronic kidney disease that incorporates clinical, lifestyle, and family history related risk factors to improve early detection and intervention?

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a continuously growing public health concern that often progresses slowly until advanced stages. This can lead to severe health complications and increased healthcare burdens. Understanding different key contributing factors to CKD development is crucial for early intervention and detection. Some significant risk factors are diabetes, hypertension, and a family history of CKD that have been widely recognized for their combined or individual roles in CKD progression. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this research aims to quantify these relationships and further evaluate the incorporation of multiple risk factors to enhance the ML CKD prediction models. By developing an in-depth ML model, this research seeks to bridge the gap between risk identification and proactive management, improving patient outcomes and reducing CKD morbidity.

The following ML models were used in our research methodology:
* Random Forest Model
* Clustering
* Logistic Regression
